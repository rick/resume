# Choose your own adventure: The resumés of Rick Bradley

I life changed at some point, so I updated my resumé. But, a resumé is just for the people who are like "tell me about your past dress code compliance and jorb trophies"... So I ended up writing a resume about life shit I actually care about.

Choose your own adventure:

 - [I wanna read about real life shit](real-fucking-resume.md)
 - [I'm pretty much just here about the jorb trophies](boring-jorb-trophies-resume.md)
